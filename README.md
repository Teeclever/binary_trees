# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## Description

> This repository contains solutions and implementations of binary tree-related problems in the C programming language. Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, each having at most two children. This project focuses on creating and manipulating binary trees in C.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a collection of C programs that demonstrate various operations on binary trees, including creation, traversal, deletion, and other essential functions. Each subdirectory contains a specific task or problem related to binary trees.
Project Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific task or problem. The structure is as follows:

    0-binary_tree_node: Create a function that creates a binary tree node.
    1-binary_tree_insert_left: Create a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
    2-binary_tree_insert_right: Create a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
    ...
    17-binary_tree_sibling: Create a function that finds the sibling of a node in a binary tree.
    18-binary_tree_uncle: Create a function that finds the uncle of a node in a binary tree.
    ...

Each directory contains a C file with the implementation of the specified task and a header file with the necessary function prototypes and data structures.
Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need:

    GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C compiler that supports C11.
    Make (optional but recommended for easy compilation).

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Teeclever/0x1D-binary_trees.git

Navigate to the desired directory:

bash

cd 0x1D-binary_trees/1-binary_tree_insert_left

Compile the C file (e.g., 0-binary_tree_node.c):

bash

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-binary_tree_node.c -o binary_tree_node

Run the compiled executable:

bash

 ./binary_tree_node

    Follow the on-screen instructions or check the code comments for details on the specific task.
